# sw-gittycat-server
GittyCat, as the name suggests, merges the principles of 'Git', the version control system, and 'Concatenate', reflecting the tool's ability to string together CI/CD pipelines. This open-source, Go-based, self-hosted CI/CD webhook listener system effectively 'concatenates' your (not only) Git workflows, bringing together a secure and efficient, scalable CI/CD solution.

# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

An open-source, self-hosted CI/CD system and weebhook listener that is designed to provide a seamless and secure experience for continuous integration and deployment. GittyCat enables the execution of automated workflows for your CI/CD needs.

Developed in Go, GittyCat natively supports a wide range of architectures including 386, arm, arm64, and amd64. 
Its versatility extends to the operating systems it can function on, with robust support for FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

One of the key focus of GittyCat is its cloning from virtually any service that allows it, including GitHub, Gitea, other services and also private repositorys.
